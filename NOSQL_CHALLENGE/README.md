# Eat Safe, Love
* The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Import the data provided in the `establishments.json` file from your Terminal. Name the database `uk_food` and the collection `establishments`.

Within this markdown cell, copy the line of text you used to import the data from your Terminal. This way, future analysts will be able to repeat your process.

e.g.: Import the dataset with `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json`
